<h1> Medical Lists: Help </h1>

<h2>
    What is Medical Lists
</h2>
Medical lists is an open-source collaborative set of medical lists.
It list causes and effects of medical terms, which fall under the top-level headings
<ol>
    <li>  Disease  </li>
    <li>  Pathology  </li>
    <li>  Symptom  </li>
    <li>  Sign  </li>
    <li>  Substance  </li>
    <li>  Procedure  </li>
    <li>  Lifestyle  </li>
</ol>
The connetions aim to be dense and causally relevant. 
<h2>
    How to contribute
</h2>
The web application has an "edit mode". When enabled, you will be able to add and remove items from lists and re-order them.
(see edit mode below). 
Each edit you make is transmitted to my server. 
These are stored separately to the original database.
When you load the application, the edits that people have made on the server are downloaded, and used to update the lists in your browser. 
If you don't want to see these "community" edits, you can turn them off in the menu.

From time to time, I will update the database using the edits, to consolidate and curate them.


You can also contribute to the code, which is on GitHub.

<h2>
    Interface
</h2>
Keyboard shortcuts
<ol>
    <li>  ctrl+F: find (highlights search bar)  </li>
    <li>  ctrl+E: enter/leave edit mode </li>
    <li>  ctrl+C: copy selection (in edit mode) </li>
    <li>  ctrl+I: show index </li>
</ol>
<h2>
    Editing interface
</h2>
You can 
<ol>
    <li>  add existing items to a list by pressing '+'.
        This will open a box which will allow you to type a name.
        As you start typing, a list of options appears. 
        You can select one with the mouse or keyboard.
        Press OK to add it.
    </li>
    <li> create a new item, from within the Add dialog.
        If the item you wish to add to a list does not exist in the database, please 
        consider whether it falls under one of the existing items.
        Also make sure the item you want to add is a unique pathological entity.
        
        If you are sure it does not exist, but should exist, you can create a new item.
        Please ensure to populate the new item with as many other causes and effects.
        Ideally it should also have a parent item.

    </li>
    <li>  re-order items in a list by dragging the handle on the right.
        Lists are supposed to be ordered by the most-likely-first.
        Mathematically, I intend this to be "highest conditional probability given the current entity".
        But in practice this isn't always how lists turn out.    
    </li>
    <li>
        select items.
        To select items, either long-press on them, or 
        press the "selection mode" icon, and then tap the items.
        You can select items across many screens, and the number of 
        currently selected items is displayed on the icon.
    </li>
    <li>
        unselect items.
        Unselect a selected item by doing the same thing again.
        Alternatively you can unselect <b>all</b> items by clicking the select mode button a second time.
    </li>
    <li>
        remove items from a list.
        To do this, select an item then press the dustbin.
        The item is also copied to the clipboard. 
    </li>
    <li>
        copy items to the clipboard.
        After selecting items, press the clipboard icon.
        This will replace items on the clipboard with the selection.
        The clipboard contents are visible in a small drop-down near the icon.
        You can click on these items to navigate to them.
    </li>

</ol>
